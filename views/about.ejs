<p> Music Hub was created by Cliff Stowe, a senior in the class of 2022 at Trinity School in New York City. Cliff is a music producer and fan, and he wanted to create a service for both fans and music professionals to find artists and tracks. Professionals can use Music Hub to identify potential collaborators, and fans use Music Hub to find new music and musicians to listen to.
